# Final Project - Build a Virtual Instrument using Decent Sampler

### Created Using: Decent Sampler, Ableton Live 12

For the final assingment, we were asked to create a virtual instrument using Decent Sampler. To do this, we needed to record our own samples of any instrument with different pitches. I decided to sample blowing on a glass bottle. In the AudioFrequency Lab, I used the microphone in a quiet environment to record 2 different samples of each pitch to be able to use a round robin. I was only able to record 3 different pitches unfortunately, because of the limited range of pitch of a glass bottle. By filling up the bottle with water, I was able to increase the pitch, but only by 2 increments on the cricle of fifths. This was enough to stretch the samples and get two octaves worth of playable notes.

Using the Decent Sampler standalone application and Visual Studio Code, I edited the xml file that makes up the virtual instrument. I used a custom image to be the background and implemented 3 effects with custom buttons. The effects are delay time, reverb, and chorus. After finishing the dsbundle, I imported it into Ableton and used midi data to play the instrument.
