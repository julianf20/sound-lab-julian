# Homework 1 - Create a Sound Using Additive Synthesis

### Created using: Pure Data

This patch in Pure Data is my attempt to recreate the analog synth pad from the song *The Whistle Song* by **Frankie Knuckles**. Many of the most well-known house songs from the time period (and electronic music in general) of 80s-90s used string synthesizers to create background chords. These string synths were additive synthesizers, many of them using very simple waveshapes like sawtooth waves and/or square waves. As someone who is new to Pure Data, I figured that this would be a good sound to recreate because of its relative simplicity. I created 4 sawtooth oscillators, and matched the frequencies to the 4 note chords in the song.

The frequency ratios used in this patch are shown below for the 4 sawtooth oscillators:

### Chord 1:
| Frequency | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 329.63 | E4 |
| 261.63 | C4 |
| 220 | A3 |
| 174.6 | F3 |
Fmaj7 (F, A, C, E)

### Chord 2:
| Frequency | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 329.63 | E4 |
| 261.63 | C4 |
| 246.9 | B3 |
| 196 | G3 |
Cmaj7 (G, B, C, E)

The sound itself is very warm and lush and it emulates the sound of an ensemble of string instruments.
