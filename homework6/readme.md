# Homework 5 - Creating a sampled instrument in Ableton Live with pitch

### Created Using: Ableton Live 12 and Audacity

In this assignment, we created a sampled instrument with pitch. Using Audacity, I recorded samples from the Korg M1 of every 5th note at a soft and hard velocity. I then loaded these samples into Ableton's sampler and created a virtual instrument. Using this instrument, I was able to play notes within a certain range as a piano.
