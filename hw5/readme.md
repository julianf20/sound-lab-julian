# Homework 5 - Creating a sampled instrument in Ableton Live with velocity and round robin

### Created Using: Ableton Live 12

In this assignment, we created a sampled instrument using percussing sound. I decided to use a marker hitting a cardboard box as my sound. I recorded 3 percussive hits of the box at 3 different velocities, soft, medium, and hard. This resulted in 9 total samples. In Ableton Live 12, I then created a sampler instrument using these samples. I assigned the 3 groups of samples corresponding to different velocities to different velocity ranges in the sampler instrument and used a random LFO to cycle through the 3 recordings at each velocity.
