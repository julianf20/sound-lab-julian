# Homework 2 - Build a Virtual Synth

### Created using: VCV Rack

In this assignment, I created two patches in VCV Rack. The two patches are very similar, producing similar sounds. The first patch is self-running; it modulates itself over time and creates certain random sounds. The second patch incorporates user input; By pressing keys on the computer keyboard, the user can effect the notes being played.

The main sound comes from the large pad-like synthesizer, which uses 3 oscillators at specified frequencies played together. The first patch also uses a random voltage generator and a quantizer to output random CV signals to another oscillator, creating random notes. The quantizer only allows for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes which ensures that the random notes are always in key with the pad sound.
